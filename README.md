### App Description

    Our app allows users to input their phyiscal data (weight & height), which
    is passed to the API and used to calculate their BMI and respective weight
    category. This data is then collectively stored into MongoDB, which 
    can be accessed by the user for review, updating, and removal. But that's 
    not all our app has to offer! We know that staying informed is key to 
    achieving your health and fitness goals, which is why we've integrated an 
    API that allows you to search for information on any topic. With the ability 
    to imitate a Google search, our app generates the top 8 webpages related to 
    your query, giving you the knowledge you need to succeed. Say goodbye to 
    cumbersome calculations and hello to easy health and fitness tracking with 
    our app!
